        This section contains some of my projects that are currently deployed online. 
        The projects are housed in repositories on GitHub and set up for <span className="maincolor">CI/CD</span> to <span className="maincolor">KenWillCode.com</span> via <span className="maincolor">GitHub Actions</span> and <span className="maincolor">GitHub Pages</span>. 
        Other projects are deployed on <span className="maincolor">Render</span> via <span className="maincolor">Github</span> and <span className="maincolor">Docker</span>.
        Please feel free to visit their respective GitHub links to see how everything is configured.
        I have many other projects that are backend/API focused and do not have a front end, these can be located within my <a href="https://github.com/GitForceJedi" style={{color: "orangered"}}>GitHub Account</a>.

When the player is prompted (X/O) they will be able to choose their move on the board. The game will continue in this fashion until a Winner is determineed or the game ends in a tie. Once finished the game can be reset for the next round.
              The project is meant to showcase the capabilities of React and the use of State to manage the game board."
